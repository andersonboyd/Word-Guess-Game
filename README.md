# Word-Guess-Game

This is where I am pseudocoding the js file:

first off we want the different options to show as:
        random word (spaces->letters) "answer"
        user guess (key event)
        discard box for wrong letters

the computer should choose a random word from a
pre-compiled list of words. while there are letters 
left in the random word, the computer should compare 
the user's inputted key to the random word chosen.

if the user guesses any letters in the random word, 
the blank spaces where the answer is should fill
in with that letter. if there user guesses an incorrect 
letter, it should be shown in a discard box below or 
to the side of the box that shows the user's input.

there needs to be a counter for wins and losses.
